        TechiEco Solutions Pvt. Ltd. is a firm that sells waste management robots built using IoT and AIML. The company's board of directors have patented the technology that they're offering. The technology aims to provide a wide range of modifications and applications. It also aims to build multiple other technologies that aid in improving the ecosystem.

        TechiEco Solutions Pvt. Ltd.â€™s ideal customers include housing societies, corporate offices and municipal corporations managing public places. However, several additional technology applications may be further developed by simply altering the training dataset. 

        Considering the significance of waste management, particularly in the medical sector, and the urgent need to preserve the environment, the waste management market in India is expected to reach USD 15 billion by 2025, growing at around 7% annually.

        As a result of the inevitable requirement for monitoring and maintenance services, the product is priced at the B2B industry level, with bigger purchases qualifying for volume discounts. TechiEco Solutions Pvt. Ltd. intends to advertise its goods digitally and at industry trade events.
